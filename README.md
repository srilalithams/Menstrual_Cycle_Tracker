# Menstrual_Cycle_Tracker
A simple menstrual cycle tracking program that asks a few questions about your cycle everyday and doesn't need the internet to run (read: doesn't store your data anywhere other than in your computer)
This program stores data related to your menstrual cycle in an excel sheet on your computer so you don't have to rack your brain for details when you next visit your gynac. 
It runs without the internet and doesn't take or store your data anywhere so full privacy. As of now there's no AI model so you'll have to manually input when you last had your period and how long your cycles are. It calculates which phase you'll be in based on that and asks you questions. 
You'll have to run the setup program once before running the GUI python code to make sure the Excel file and json file get created properly. If you don't have python just download the 2 files from my code and input the date you had your last period and how long your cycle is in the json file. You can open it on notepad.
You can also (obviously) make whatever changes you want to the OG source code (death of the author and all) and have dark mode, light mode, goth mode, or any other cool things you want, if you're someone who knows python. 
If you don't know python, you can just get the app from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G48JsS5EaW_16iMEP_MQaH19K120swEy?usp=sharing
One request: it'll be really nice if you share the changes you make in this to help other people out! Kthxbye!
